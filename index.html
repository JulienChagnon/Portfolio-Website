    <!-- Introduction text -->
    <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
      Hello! I’m Julien Chagnon, a bilingual (French/English) computer engineering student at Queen’s University currently entering my 3rd year.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a personal project during Summer 2025, I taught myself HTML, CSS, and JS and decided to develop this website to showcase my competencies to potential employers. This portfolio website covers my projects, work history, education & skills, and professional certifications.
      Explore the pages ahead or press the labels on the sidebar to navigate sections. I look forward to connecting!

    <!-- About Me section -->
    <section id="About-Me">
      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
        Through my coursework and independent projects, I have developed extensive programming skills in C, Python, Java, and Assembly, and I am proficient in working within Linux environments. I have also cultivated front-end web development experience using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript through online resources.
      </p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
        My interests extend into hardware systems and circuit design, where I have gained practical experience with VHDL, LTspice, and Arduino platforms. I have applied these skills in hands-on labs and team-based design projects, enhancing my abilities in CAD modeling (SolidWorks), SPICE-based circuit simulation, circuit and software debugging, and collaborative development using Git and GitHub. Through courses like Data Science, I also have experience with database design and management using SQL and HDF5, along with data visualization using Python libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn.

        <p>
          I am also involved in extracurricular activities at Queen’s, including the Ski and Snowboard Club. In second year, I was a member of the Queen’s University First-Year Engineering Committee (FREC), where I helped organize events and initiatives for incoming engineering students. As part of the role, I wore the iconic FREC outfit and dyed my body purple (pictured on the left). This experience built my leadership and teamwork skills as I helped create a welcoming environment for first-years and grew more connected to the Queen’s Engineering community.

        <p>
          Outside of computer engineering, I’m passionate about outdoor sports like Mountain Biking, Skiing, and Kiteboarding, which are activities I enjoy regularly in and around my hometown of Ottawa with my family. The photo on the right shows me with my dad and brother at Mont Tremblant bike resort in Québec. These activities have always been a big part of my life, spending time outdoors has helped me maintain a balance between academic work and personal well-being.

              As part of a Data Science group project, our 3-student team developed a complete human activity recognition system that processes raw smartphone accelerometer data to distinguish between walking and jumping. Following a structured workflow encompassing data collection, hierarchical HDF5 storage, signal visualization, preprocessing, feature extraction and normalization, classifier training, and GUI deployment, we leveraged Python’s scientific stack (pandas, h5py, scipy, scikit‑learn) to import CSV files from an accelerometer app, clean and smooth the time series with forward‑fill and moving‑average filters, extract a suite of 40 statistical features per 5‑second window, train a logistic regression classifier to over 95% accuracy, and finally package the process into a Tkinter desktop application.

              <p style="margin-bottom: 0.7em;">
                My contributions encompassed model training and GUI for data visualization. I helped design and train the logistic regression classifier by preprocessing labeled accelerometer data, evaluating model performance through metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall, also analyzing confusion matrices to identify common misclassifications between walking and jumping. On the GUI side, I built the user interface using Tkinter and implemented the segment_and_extract function to dynamically partition input CSV data into time-based windows. I integrated the trained logistic regression model and normalization scaler (using joblib) into the classify_csv function, enabling real-time predictions on user data. Classification results were visualized using matplotlib, with colour coded overlays indicating detected activity types and a scrollable output displaying timestamped labels.
              </p>
            </div>
            <p>
              We used Git throughout the development process to collaborate on code and manage version control. The resulting GUI offered an intuitive, real-time visualization of classification output, meeting our goal of creating a self-contained, user-friendly activity-tracking tool. A full breakdown of the implementation and user interface can be seen in the demonstration video and final project report.
